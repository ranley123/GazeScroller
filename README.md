This is a Python (2 and 3) library that provides a **Gaze-Tracking Scroller** based on deep learning models. It is based on [GazeTracking](https://github.com/antoinelame/GazeTracking) repository by identifying real-time position of the pupils and the gaze direction. Apart from that, this project implements a scroller function helping to scroll every document-like pages!
